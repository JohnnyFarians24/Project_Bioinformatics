[PATHS]
# Instructions:
# 1. Install all external tools (Java, Trimmomatic, PEAR, etc.).
# 2. Enter the full path for each executable below.
# 3. In Windows, use normal slashes (/) or double slashes (\\). Ex: C:/Tools/pear.exe
# 4. If a tool is in the system PATH, you can just leave its name (e.g. fastqc).

# --- Paths to External Tools ---
